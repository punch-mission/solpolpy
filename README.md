`solpolpy` is a solar polarization resolver based on [Deforest et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac43b6).
It converts between various polarization formats, e.g. from the native three triple version from observations
(also known as the MZP convention) to polarization brightness (pB) and total polarization (B).
