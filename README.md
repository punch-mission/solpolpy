ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ **UNDER DEVELOPMENT** ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

`solpolpy` is a solar polarization resolver based on [Deforest et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac43b6).
It converts between various polarization formats, e.g. from the native three triple version from observations
(also known as the MZP convention) to polarization brightness (pB) and total polarization (B), Stokes I, Q and U, etc.
As it is in early development, breaking changes may be frequent. 

An example of transforming the polarization basis using the LASCO/C2 images is 
shown in the image below.  The images at polarizing angles of -60Â°, 0Â° and +60Â° is shown in the top panel as 
Bm, Bz and Bp respectively. The bottom panel shows the output of the `solpolpy` to convert the initial basis 
to the Stokes I, Q and U.

## Quickstart
`pip install solpolpy`

We recommend following along the examples in [the documentation](https://punch-mission.github.io/solpolpy/quickstart.html)! 

## Getting Help
Please open a discussion or issue for help. 

## Features Coming Soon
- [x] core transformation capability
- [x] clearer examples in the documentation
- [ ] quantification and propagation of error 
- [ ] additional plotting utilities 
- [ ] more comprehensive support for 4-polarizer systems
- [ ] functions to deal with the IMAX effect in wide-field imagers

## Contributing

## Origin of the Name
`solpolpy` is just a combination of `sol` for solar, `pol` for polarization, and `py` for Python.
