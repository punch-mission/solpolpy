# Welcome to `solpolpy`

`solpolpy` is a Python package for transforming between different polarization
systems in solar and heliophysics.


An example of transforming the polarization basis using the LASCO/C2 images is 
shown in the image below.
The images at polarizing angles of -60°, 0° and +60° is shown in the top panel as 
Bm, Bz and Bp respectively.
The bottom panel shows the output of the `solpolpy` to convert the initial basis 
to the Stokes I, Q and U.
