Welcome to solpolpy's documentation!
====================================

``solpolpy`` is a Python package for transforming between different polarization systems in solar and heliophysics.

An example of transforming the polarization basis using the LASCO/C2 images is shown in the image below. The images at polarizing angles of -60°, 0° and +60° is shown in the top panel as Bm, Bz and Bp respectively. The bottom panel shows the output of the solpolpy to convert the initial basis to the Stokes I, Q and U.
